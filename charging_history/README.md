The script `analyze_charging_history.py` generates a bar diagram using Matplotlib to visualize the charging history stored in the `charging_history_full.csv` file. It also computes the average daily charging costs based on this data. Additionally, the script includes a commented-out section that, when enabled, can produce bar diagrams for weekly or monthly charging amounts.
