# Miscellaneous Scripts

This folder houses additional scripts developed for my homework on surplus charging, providing supplementary tools for analysis and visualization.

## Cost Visualization

The script `create_cost_bar_diagram` generates a bar diagram using Matplotlib to illustrate the expected annual costs of the four charging methods. It offers a clear visual comparison of the financial implications of each approach.
