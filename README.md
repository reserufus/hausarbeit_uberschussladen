This github repository contains all code used in my homework for the simulation of charging algorithms.

Python is required to run this code.
To install all required dependencies, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then you can navigate into the subfolders to run the Python scripts. Each subfolder contains an additional README file that provides instructions on the code of the subfolder.
