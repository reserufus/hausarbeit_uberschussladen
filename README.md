# Code for my Homework
This github repository contains all code used in my homework, including the simulation, but also code for fetching data, analyzing data and creating diagrams. It also includes some of the data used for the simulation.

Python is required to run this code.
To install all required dependencies, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then you can navigate into the subfolders to run the Python scripts. Each subfolder contains an additional README file that provides instructions on the code of the subfolder.
